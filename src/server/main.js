   <p>All code is buggy. It stands to reason, therefore, that the more code you have to write the buggier your apps will be.</p>
   <p>Writing more code also takes more time, leaving less time for other things like optimisation, nice-to-have features, or being outdoors instead of hunched over a laptop.</p>
   <p>In fact it's widely acknowledged that  and  grow quadratically, not linearly, with the size of a codebase. That tracks with our intuitions: a ten-line pull request will get a level of scrutiny rarely applied to a 100-line one. And once a given module becomes too big to fit on a single screen, the cognitive effort required to understand it increases significantly. We compensate by refactoring and adding comments — activities that almost always result in more code. It's a vicious cycle.</p>
   <p>Yet while we obsess — rightly! — over performance numbers, bundle size and anything else we can measure, we rarely pay attention to the amount of code we're writing.</p>

      subtitle: `Let's retire the 'virtual DOM is fast' myth once and for all`,
      content: `
   <p>If you've used JavaScript frameworks in the last few years, you've probably heard the phrase 'the virtual DOM is fast', often said to mean that it's faster than the real DOM. It's a surprisingly resilient meme — for example people have asked how Svelte can be fast when it doesn't use a virtual DOM.</p>

   <p>Malina.js builds your web-application to use it without framework on frontend side. Therefore your web-app becomes thinner and faster, and the application itself consist of vanilla JavaScript, look at examples. TodoMVC example 2.7kb (gzipped) and source code</p>
